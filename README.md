## About The Project

This is an iteration of the [example](https://github.com/jason-lang/jason/tree/master/examples/domestic-robot) proposed at [jason](https://github.com/jason-lang/jason), with the intent of expanding its functionality beyond a single supermarket and a single robot performing actions, as requiered by a Intelligent Systems assignement.

The main functionality improvements of the project can be summarized as follows:

* One or more supermarkets may compete with each other by selling beers at different prices and delivery times.
* Robot is now a butler, who controlls various automatons, in particular:
  * Cleaner: in charge of collecting cans from floor and from owner hands.
  * Dustman: in charge of taking out the garbage when the trash bin is completely full.
  * Mover: in charge of taking beers from the frisge to the owner and from the delivery location to the fridge.
* Changes in balance and supermarket and fridge storages are now disk persistent.
* Owner, supermarket and butler now implement natural language communications through AIML.
